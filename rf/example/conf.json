### Configuration file for rf package in json format

### Options for input and output ###

# Filename of events file (QuakeML format)
"events": "example_events.xml",

# Filename of inventory of stations (StationXML format)
"inventory": "example_inventory.xml",

# Data can be 
#   1. a glob expression of files. All files are read at once. If you have
#      a huge dataset think about using one of the other two available
#      options.
#   2. one of "arclink", "seishub" or "fdsn" for getting the data from
#      a webservice. Option "client_options" is available.
#   3. "plugin" for a heterogeneus dataset. You have the freedom to get your
#       data from different locations. In this case the option "plugin" is
#       availlable
"data": "example_data.mseed",

# Options for the webservices which are passed to Client.__init__.
# See the documentation of the clients in ObsPy for availlable options.
"client_options": {"user": "name@insitution.com"},                    

# Where to find the plugin in the form "module : func"
# 'module' has to be importable (located in current path or PYTHON_PATH
# environment variable). 
# 'func' has to be the function which delivers the data, e.g. for a
# FSDN client:
#     # in module.py
#     from obspy.fsdn import Client
#     client = Client()
#     def func(**kwargs):
#         kwargs.pop('event')  # event kwarg is not needed by client
#         return client.get_waveforms(**kwargs)
# Kwargs passed to func are: network, station, location, channel,
# starttime, endtime and event
"plugin": "module : func",

# Directory for optional waveform caching from webservice or plugin.
# This works only if the waveforms are requested with the exact same
# parameters (start and end time) i.e. if options
# events and request_window are left untouched.
# This option needs the module joblib. 
"cache_waveforms": null,

# Possibility to define your own logging configuration. This dictionary
# will be passed to logging.config.dictConfig.
# null will log to a file and stdout depending on 'logfile', 'loglevel'
# and '-v' flag (logging is quite sparse at the moment)
"logging": null,

# Log file or null. Output to stdout can be configured with the -v flag
"logfile": "example.log",

# The higher the log level the more verbose is the logging to the file (1-3)
"loglevel": 3,

# File format for receiver functions (one of "Q", "SAC" or "H5")
"format": "Q",

# All receiver functions and plots are stored relative to this path
"path": ".",
